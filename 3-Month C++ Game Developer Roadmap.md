## ðŸ—“ Month 1 â€“ Master Modern C++ for Games

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Deepen your understanding of **C++17/20**
- Learn **memory management**, **OOP**, and **data-oriented design**
- Get comfortable with **math for games**

### ðŸ§© Topics to Cover
1. **C++ Core Mastery**
   - Smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`)
   - RAII and resource management
   - Move semantics, copy elision
   - Templates and type traits
   - Namespaces, inline variables, constexpr

2. **C++ Design Patterns**
   - Singleton, Factory, Observer, Component
   - Strategy and State patterns (common in game engines)

3. **Math for Games**
   - Vectors, matrices, quaternions
   - Linear algebra basics
   - Coordinate transformations

4. **Debugging and Profiling**
   - `gdb`, Visual Studio Debugger, or CLion tools
   - Basic profiling with `valgrind` or `perf`

### ðŸ“š Recommended Books
- *Effective Modern C++* â€“ Scott Meyers  
- *Game Programming Patterns* â€“ Robert Nystrom  
- *Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics* â€“ Eric Lengyel

### ðŸ§  Practice Ideas
- Write your own `Vector2D` and `Matrix4x4` classes  
- Create a simple 2D bouncing ball simulation  
- Implement a simple event system using the Observer pattern

## ðŸ—“ Month 2 â€“ Build with Frameworks and Engines

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Learn to use **graphics APIs and engines**
- Understand **game loop, rendering, and input**
- Start building **a playable prototype**

### ðŸ§© Topics to Cover
1. **Game Loop Architecture**
   - Updateâ€“Render cycles
   - Delta time and frame independence
   - FPS management

2. **Graphics Basics**
   - 2D rendering with **SDL2** or **SFML**
   - Textures, sprites, animation
   - Input handling (keyboard, mouse)

3. **Physics & Collision**
   - Basic bounding box and circle collision
   - Gravity and velocity updates
   - Simple physics integration

4. **Engines (Optional but Powerful)**
   - Unreal Engine (C++) â€” AAA focus  
   - Godot (GDExtension C++) â€” indie-friendly  
   - Custom engine (for learning)

### ðŸ“š Recommended Learning
- **SFML Game Development By Example** â€“ Raimondas Pupius  
- **Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer Course** (Udemy)  
- **Lazy Fooâ€™s SDL2 Tutorials**

### ðŸ§  Practice Ideas
- Build a **2D Breakout/Space Invaders clone**  
- Add particle effects and basic sound  
- Implement a pause menu and score tracking

## ðŸ—“ Month 3 â€“ Create a Game Project and Portfolio

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Build a **full small game**
- Learn **asset management**, **AI**, and **optimization**
- Prepare your **portfolio and resume**

### ðŸ§© Topics to Cover
1. **AI & Game Logic**
   - Finite State Machines (FSM)
   - Pathfinding (A*, Dijkstra)
   - Behavior trees (optional)

2. **Scripting & Tools**
   - Lua integration for in-game scripting
   - Simple level editor (optional)

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Data-oriented design (SoA vs AoS)
   - Multithreading basics
   - Profiling and memory leaks

4. **Project Deployment**
   - Cross-platform builds (Windows/Linux/macOS)
   - Packaging assets and executables
   - Version control with Git

5. **Portfolio Building**
   - Document your project on GitHub
   - Write dev blogs or record gameplay demos
   - Polish your README and include screenshots

### ðŸ§  Final Project Ideas
- 2D Platformer (Mario clone)  
- Top-down shooter  
- Tile-based puzzle game  
- Simple physics sandbox
